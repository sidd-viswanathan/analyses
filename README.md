## sparse_covariance_estimation

Analyzes a financial dataset of 504 measurements of daily adjusted closing prices of 1547 medium-sized companies to explore, implement, and compare four methods for large covariance matrix estimation. The results do not indicate any clearly optimal method but provide insight into the immense difficulty of optimal high-dimensional covariance estimation.


## network_centrality_forecasting

Studies the relationship of network centrality measures and vector time series analysis using a historical network of diplomatic representation observed every few years from the years 1817-2005. Given any dynamic network it should at each timepoint be possible to perform vector time series analysis by reducing the network structure to the network centrality measure over each node. Provides cointegration analysis of the dynamic centrality-based time series and residual analysis of the fitted model.


## high_dimensional_classification

Analyzes a dataset of 373 labeled executables each with 531 described attributes to study the performance of four types of malicious executable classifiers. Finds the support vector machine the most successful algorithm for generalizing to new data.


## analysis_of_crash_on_stock_price

Uses 191 data points of closing stock market price from February 2002 to December 2015 to build a time series model which includes the intervention of the stock market crash during the 2007 Summer. The intervention is modeled as a pulse. Tests are performed to see the series requires differencing and residual analysis is performed on the fitted intervention time series model.


## undergraduate_honors_thesis

Presents a matching-based methodology for estimating causal effects on generating mechanisms of entire network structures. The method is suitable for studies assessing the impact of interventions on interactions within a networks. The method is illustrated on data from a natural experiment in Michigan to estimate the effect of non-compete laws on inventor collaborations. 


## variance_reduction_in_bipartite_experiments

Implements the algorithm for variance reduction in bipartite experiments presented in (Pouget-Abadie et al., 2018) and generates figures studying the convergence of the algorithm in relation to the number of clusters in the bipartite experiment.
