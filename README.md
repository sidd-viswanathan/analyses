Descriptions for the five Data Analyses and four Statistics Research Papers.

# Data Analyses

## Sparse covariance estimation for financial time series

file: sparse_covariance_estimation.pdf

Analyzes a financial dataset of 504 measurements of daily adjusted closing prices of 1547 medium-sized companies to explore, implement, and compare four methods for large covariance matrix estimation. The results do not indicate any clearly optimal method but provide insight into the difficulty of optimal high-dimensional covariance estimation. 

## Study of variance reduction in bipartite experiments

file: variance_reduction_in_bipartite_experiments.pdf

Implements the algorithm for variance reduction in bipartite experiments presented in (Pouget-Abadie et al., 2018) and generates figures studying the convergence of the algorithm in relation to the number of clusters in the bipartite experiment. 

## High-dimensional classification for malware detection

file: high_dimensional_classification.pdf

Analyzes a dataset of 373 labeled file executables each with 531 described attributes to study the performance of four types of malicious executable classifiers. Finds the support vector machine as the most successful algorithm for generalizing to new data.

## Intervention model for market crash on stock price

file: analysis_of_crash_on_stock_price.pdf

Uses 191 data points of closing stock market price from February 2002 to December 2015 to build a time series model which includes the intervention of the stock market crash during the 2007 Summer. The intervention is modeled as a pulse. Tests are performed to see the series requires differencing and residual analysis is performed on the fitted intervention time series model.

## Network centrality forecasting from historical diplomatic data

file: network_centrality_forecasting.pdf

Studies the relationship of network centrality measures and vector time series analysis using a historical network of diplomatic representation observed every few years from the years 1817-2005. Given any dynamic network it should at each timepoint be possible to perform vector time series analysis by reducing the network structure to the network centrality measure over each node. Provides cointegration analysis of the dynamic centrality-based time series and residual analysis of the fitted model.


# Statistics Research Papers

## Propensity and Specification

file: propensity_and_specification.pdf

Develops and interprets a formula for the propensity score that clarifies the role of the propensity score for population specification in observational studies. 

## Interpretation of Asymptotic Rerandomization

file: asymptotic_rerandomization.pdf

Interpretation and literature review of a non-Gaussian asymptotic distribution in the theory of rerandomization.

## Characterizing Statistical Physics

file: statistical_physics.pdf

Develops ideas at the intersection of statistical causal inference and statistical physics.

## Nonrandomized Network Causality

file: nonrandomized_network_causality.pdf

An organization of the recent statistics literature combining network theory and observational studies.
