## Sparse covariance estimation of stock portfolio

file: sparse_covariance_estimation.pdf

Analyzes a financial dataset of 504 measurements of daily adjusted closing prices of 1547 medium-sized companies to explore, implement, and compare four methods for large covariance matrix estimation. The results do not indicate any clearly optimal method but provide insight into the difficulty of optimal high-dimensional covariance estimation.

## Network centrality forecasting on dynamic diplomatic data

file: network_centrality_forecasting.pdf

Studies the relationship of network centrality measures and vector time series analysis using a historical network of diplomatic representation observed every few years from the years 1817-2005. Given any dynamic network it should at each timepoint be possible to perform vector time series analysis by reducing the network structure to the network centrality measure over each node. Provides cointegration analysis of the dynamic centrality-based time series and residual analysis of the fitted model.

## Differences-in-differences methodology for sparse network causal effects

file: differences-in-differences_methodology.pdf

Presents a differences-in-differences methodology for estimating causal effects on generating mechanisms of network structures. The method is suitable for studies assessing the impact of interventions on interactions generating a network. The full data contains over eight million inventor-patents and career histories for 540,780 inventors. The method for causal effects is illustrated on data from a natural experiment in Michigan to estimate the effect of non-compete laws on inventor collaboration. There are however many difficulties and points requiring further clarification with the estimation procedure and methodological contributions. 

## High-dimensional classification for malware detection

file: high_dimensional_classification.pdf

Analyzes a dataset of 373 labeled file executables each with 531 described attributes to study the performance of four types of malicious executable classifiers. Finds the support vector machine the most successful algorithm for generalizing to new data.

## Variance reduction in bipartite experiments

file: variance_reduction_in_bipartite_experiments.pdf

Implements the algorithm for variance reduction in bipartite experiments presented in (Pouget-Abadie et al., 2018) and generates figures studying the convergence of the algorithm in relation to the number of clusters in the bipartite experiment. 

## Intervention model for market crash on stock price

file: analysis_of_crash_on_stock_price.pdf

Uses 191 data points of closing stock market price from February 2002 to December 2015 to build a time series model which includes the intervention of the stock market crash during the 2007 Summer. The intervention is modeled as a pulse. Tests are performed to see the series requires differencing and residual analysis is performed on the fitted intervention time series model.
