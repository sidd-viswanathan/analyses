## variance_reduction_in_bipartite_experiments.pdf

Implements the algorithm for variance reduction in bipartite experiments presented in (Pouget-Abadie et al., 2018) and generates figures studying the convergence of the algorithm in relation to the number of clusters in the bipartite experiment. 

## undergraduate_honors_thesis.pdf

Presents a matching-based methodology for estimating causal effects on generating mechanisms of entire network structures. The method is suitable for studies assessing the impact of interventions on interactions within a networks. The method is illustrated on data from a natural experiment in Michigan to estimate the effect of non-compete laws on inventor collaborations.
