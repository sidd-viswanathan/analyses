## variance_reduction_in_bipartite_experiments.pdf

Implements the algorithm for variance reduction in bipartite experiments presented in (Pouget-Abadie et al., 2018) and generates figures studying the convergence of the algorithm in relation to the number of clusters in the bipartite experiment. 

## undergraduate_honors_thesis.pdf

Presents a matching-based methodology for estimating causal effects on generating mechanisms of entire network structures. The method is suitable for studies assessing the impact of interventions on interactions within a networks. The method is illustrated on data from a natural experiment in Michigan to estimate the effect of non-compete laws on inventor collaborations. 

## sparse_covariance_estimation.pdf

Analyzes a financial dataset of 504 measurements of daily adjusted closing prices of 1547 medium-sized companies to explore, implement, and compare four methods for large covariance matrix estimation. The results do not indicate any clearly optimal method but provide insight into the immense difficulty of optimal high-dimensional covariance estimation.

## high_dimensional_classification.pdf

Analyzes a dataset of 373 labeled executables each with 531 described attributes to study the performance of four types of malicious executable classifiers. Finds the support vector machine the most successful algorithm for generalizing to new data.
